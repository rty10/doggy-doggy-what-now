GENERAL INFORMATION
Shelter Animals Count (SAC) is a collaborative, independent organization formed by a diverse group of stakeholders to create and share the national database of sheltered animal statistics, providing facts, and enabling insights that will improve animal welfare throughout the country. The SAC database uses the Basic Data Matrix framework specified by the National Federation of Humane Societies. 

Since there is no national requirement for reporting, all the data is self-reported and contains natural under and over-sampling biases in both the geographic and organization type dimensions. In other words, some areas had a greater level of reporting than others. Comparing absolute numbers is difficult because of the incomplete dataset at this point. We hope in the future to have a complete dataset that will allow for more detailed analysis than can be done today.

THIS DATASET
The data included in this file was self-reported by US-based shelter and rescue organizations. It is aggregated by state and year and includes only those organizations with complete data for the full time period. It is a sample of data submitted to the National Database and trends may not align with the National Totals, which include estimated data.

Report period start: 2021-01-01
Report period end: 2023-12-31

#### 2021 Update

Prior to 2021, the database was limited to cats and dogs and used 14 categories for intakes and outcomes. With the release of the v202101 Basic Data Matrix, the species list expanded to include six additional animal types, transfers were disaggregated to capture distance traveled, and a new category for seized/impounded was added (previously counted under "other intakes").

This file combines previous transfer fields with current transfer fields to maintain consistency across the 3-year period. Seized/impounded fields are combined with "other intakes" to maintain consistency across the 3-year period.

Similarly, because additional species were added in 2021, data entry for those new animal types is underrepresented.This file only contains dog and cat species data.
